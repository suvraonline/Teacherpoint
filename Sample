Title:
Data Engineering Metadata Catalog Description Enhancer

Problem Statement:
Metadata catalogs often contain sparse or uninformative dataset descriptions, complicating data discovery and governance. Enhancing descriptions manually is labor-intensive and inconsistent. A generative AI agent that automatically enriches metadata descriptions by synthesizing data schema, sample data, and usage context can improve catalog usability and data literacy.

Data Requirements:
Dataset schemas

Sample records

Lineage metadata from data catalogs

Usage logs and query patterns

Existing metadata descriptions for reference

Domain ontologies and glossaries

(Feel free to generate synthetic data as well from the provided access)

Expected Output:
The deliverable is an automated metadata description generator producing enriched text for catalog entries. Outputs include structured descriptions with sections for:

Content

Quality

Usage tips

The agent provides description exports in JSON or XML for catalog ingestion.
